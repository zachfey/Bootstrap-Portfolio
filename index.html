            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/desertcrop.PNG" alt="Picture of me" class="responsive rounded" id="selfie"/>
            <p>Graduating from Georgia Tech with a Chemical Engineering degree in 2015, I immediately sought to broden my horizons. 
                I did so in a big way by joining Shclumberger to work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. 
                During my time there, I proved myself to be more than capable of designing, executing, and evaluating million dollar operations. 
                I became comfortable working under extreme pressure as I played in key role in team of nine which took over the milllion dollar-a-day rigs to perform our jobs.
                Often, we had free time on the rigs while waiting on othe service providers. I took advantage of this free time to teach myself how to program, and I enjoyed it greatly.
                To get out of the field, I needed three promotions. For my thrid promotion, I was required to complete a project which had significant business impact to Schlumberger.
                I chose to work with the programming team responsible for our proprietary job design and execution suite to add an entirely new module. The project was going well, and my team was excited for me to finish it.
                During this time, my manager left his position and I was selected to replace him while finishing my project. I enjoyed managing my team, but I quickly began to miss the excitement from the field.
                I realized that my position at Schlumberger was not particularly challenging when not offshore, so I again sought to broden my horizons.
                <br><br>
                I used the knowledge gained from studying offshore to obtain a job as a Production Engineer with Toyota Denso Compressor Georgia, LLC (TACG) back near my hometown. I am very much enjoying this job and its challenges.
                In this position, I am part of a team of five which maintains and improves three of the plant's seven assembly lines. My current role includes PLC programming, machine modifications and designs, vision system programming, 
                robot/IAI programming, and more. I have again proven myself to be a valuable member of the team by quickly gaining technical knowledge and using it to solve tricky problems to save plant downtime.
                <br><br>
                From my project at Schlumberger and my current duties at TACG, I have learned that I have a knack for programming and that I love doing it. I was hired by my former Schlumberger manager to create an Excel spreadsheet
                using VBA which automates his post-job process. The project took about 30 hours to complete and I enjoyed every minute of it. I realized then that I could easily see myself programming for a living. 
                I realized that not having any formal training could make it difficult to get a job. Further, I was infinitely curious as to what best practices or basic knowledge I didn't know about. 
                Therefore, I signed up for a full stack web developer certification from Georgia Tech. I'm excited to learn from the course and take my programming knowledge to a more professional level.
